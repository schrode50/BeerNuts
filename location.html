    <p>We do not have our own kitchen... so please feel free to bring your own food, get take-out, or have food delivered while you enjoy our beer[s!].  Seattle is home to an impressively delicious variety of food. We are more than happy if you bring food with you to our tasting room to enjoy. Please don't hesitate to ask us about what we think pairs best with your food... we're happy to help and thrilled to have you here. Cheers!</p>
