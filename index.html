        <p>Why Support Local Breweries...Craft beer may not be something that comes to mind when you are thinking about local economic influence. However, in Washington it is making quite an impact. Roughly 70.8% of the nations used hops are harvested in Washington State. Additionally the craft beer industry in Washington has an economic impact of over $1 billion annually. This mean it is also contributing to the job market supplying over 13,000 jobs to people regionally. Washington ranks 10th in overall economic impact in the United States. It is important to support these local breweries and keep the industry flourishing!

        <h4> Drink local! </h4>
        <p>Washington is in a lucky place. Bart Watson, economist for the Brewer’s Association, put it, “When both the resources and the beer are made in state, all of that revenue goes right back into the state.” Local breweries, of which there are currently 274 in Washington State alone, support the local grain and hop farmers. In turn the local restaurants put the local beers on tap and all the economic profit remains within our state. We are in a position to watch this industry of smaller breweries grow and help people gain employment, restaurants gain patronage, and farmers continue to produce and sell more of their crops. </p>
